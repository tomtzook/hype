# hype

__Hype__ is a type 1 hypervisor for the _Intel x86-64_ architecture
utilizing the _VT-x_ virtualization technology, written in _C++_. 
__Hype__ is capable of booting directly from _UEFI_.

At the moment, the project is planned for running a _linux distro_,
but this may change.

__Note: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS__.

This is mostly a research and experimentation project rather then
a product for use.
